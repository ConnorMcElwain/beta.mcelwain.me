Urbana, Illinois · On-site · Full-time <br />

I'm an accomplished IT Technical Specialist at the University of Illinois, where I contribute to the seamless operation of critical facilities and services. With a dedication to ensuring a robust technological environment, I oversee IT support for over 300 staff and 1,000 students, spanning a range of departments including the Large Animal Clinic, Small Animal Clinic, Basic Science Research Center, South Clinic, Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, and more. My responsibilities extend to managing a substantial inventory of over 10,000 electronic and medical devices, employing tools such as Active Directory, Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager, and Web Help Desk's Inventory System. This allows me to efficiently administer user accounts, permissions, email lists, devices, and shared drives, fostering an environment of productivity and collaboration. I specialize in configuring and maintaining communication systems like Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams, optimizing interdepartmental communication. In recognition of my expertise, I led a successful project that transitioned the phone system from Skype for Business to Microsoft Teams, enhancing communication capabilities across the board. My role encompasses the installation, configuration, and management of a variety of technology assets, from printers and label makers to workstations and servers. Through my commitment to staying informed about emerging technologies, I continuously refine existing systems and processes to elevate overall efficiency. Providing exceptional customer service, troubleshooting guidance, and training to students, doctors, and professors are integral aspects of my approach.
