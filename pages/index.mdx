# Introduction
Thank you for checking out my website! I want to build this space to reflect my personal and professional goals, experiences, achievements, and more! Within the next couple of months, I'm hoping to push this site out of beta and publish a lot of content on [projects](/projects) I'm working on and [documentation](/posts/azure) for certifications I will acquire.

Please check out my <Link href="/Resume.pdf">Resume</Link>, [experience page](/experience), or [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/connor-mcelwain/) for in-depth information on my professional experience! If you would like to get in contact with me, please email me at [connor@mcelwain.me](mailto:connor@mcelwain.me).
