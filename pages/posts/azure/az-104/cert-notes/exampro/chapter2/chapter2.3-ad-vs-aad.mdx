# AZ-104 Certification Notes
## Chapter 2.3 AD vs AAD

### Active Directory vs Azure Active Directory
Microsoft introduced **Active Directory** Domain Services in Windows 2000 to give organizations the ability to manage on-premises infrastructure components and systems using a single identity per user.

**Azure AD** takes this approach to the next level by providing organizations with an Identity as a Service (IDaaS) solution for all their apps **across cloud and on-premises.**

Both versions are still used today
* Active Directory
	* The **on-premise** version
* Azure AD
	* The **cloud** version
