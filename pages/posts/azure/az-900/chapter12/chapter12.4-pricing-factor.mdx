# AZ-900 Certification Notes
## Chapter 12.4 - Pricing Factor

### Influences on Pricing
* Resource Size
	* Different sizes of resources will have different pricing. A more powerful virtual machine will cost more
* Resource Type
	* There is a very big difference in the amount of hardware resources needed for various types of resources, as well as complexity
* Location
	* Different Azure locations have different prices for services. Exchange rates, labor costs and more have an influence on the price
* Bandwidth
	* The bandwidth your services are using incurs a cost as well

### Zones & Bandwidth
Azure has three billing zones in the world. Each of these zones include many Azure regions. Any data transfer between Azure services located in the same zone is free. Any data transfer between two different billing zones is charged. This is also called ingress, data in, and egress, data out, data. Ingress data is always free, but egress data (data going out) has a cost with it when it's transmitted between two different billing zones.
