In a private cloud, hardware must be purchased for start up and maintenance. In a private cloud, organizations control resources and security. Quick provisioning is a characteristic of the public cloud deployment model. Paying only for what is used is a characteristic of the public cloud deployment model.

### Question 2
* What are two basic services provided by all cloud providers? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.
	* **compute**
	* **storage**

All cloud providers provide compute and storage services. Colocation is when a business rents space in a shared physical datacenter. Application development is the responsibility of the customer and is typically done either in-house or through a third party.

### Question 3
* Which two characteristics are common advantages of cloud computing? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.
	* **geo-distribution**
	* **high availability**

Cloud-based apps can provide a continuous user experience with no apparent downtime, even when things go wrong. You can deploy apps and data to regional datacenters around the globe, thereby ensuring that your customers always have the best performance in their region. Apps in cloud computing can scale vertically and horizontally. In a public cloud model, you do not get physical access to servers, as they are managed by the cloud provider.

### Question 4
* Which cloud deployment model are you using if you have servers physically located at your organization’s on-site datacenter, and you migrate a few of the servers to the cloud?
	* **hybrid cloud**

A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that combines a public cloud and a private cloud by allowing data and applications to be shared between them.

### Question 5
* Increasing compute capacity for an app by adding RAM or CPUs to a virtual machine is called **[answer choice]**.
	* **vertical scaling**

You scale vertically to increase compute capacity by adding RAM or CPUs to a virtual machine. Scaling horizontally increases compute capacity by adding instances of resources, such as adding virtual machines to the configuration.

### Question 6
* Deploying and configuring cloud-based resources quickly as business requirements change is called **[answer choice]**.
	* **agility**

Agility means that you can deploy and configure cloud-based resources quickly as app requirements change. Scalability means that you can add RAM, CPU, or entire virtual machines to a configuration. Elasticity means that you can configure cloud-based apps to take advantage of autoscaling, so apps always have the resources they need. High availability means that cloud-based apps can provide a continuous user experience with no apparent downtime, even when things go wrong.

### Question 7
* Increasing compute capacity for an app by adding instances of resources such as virtual machines is called **[answer choice]**.
	* **horizontal scaling**

Scaling horizontally increases compute capacity by adding instances of resources, such as adding virtual machines to the configuration. You scale vertically by adding RAM or CPUs to a virtual machine. Disaster recovery keeps data and other assets safe in the event of a disaster. High availability minimizes downtime when things go wrong.

### Question 8
* An example of **[answer choice]** is automatically scaling an application to ensure that the application has the resources needed to meet customer demands.
	* **elasticity**

Elasticity refers to the ability to scale resources as needed, such as during business hours, to ensure that an application can keep up with demand, and then reducing the available resources during off-peak hours. Agility refers to the ability to deploy new applications and services quickly. High availability refers to the ability to ensure that a service or application remains available in the event of a failure. Geo-distribution makes a service or application available in multiple geographic locations that are typically close to your users.

### Question 9
* In which two deployment models are customers responsible for managing operating systems that host applications? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.
