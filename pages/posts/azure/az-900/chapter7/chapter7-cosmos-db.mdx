# AZ-900 Certification Notes
## Chapter 7 - Cosmos DB

### Synchronization
* Easy with Cosmos
	* Traditional databases that weren't cloud enabled could be very difficult to set up across multiple regions. Azure takes care of all of it with Cosmos
* One Click to Add Regions
	* It's very easy to expand to more regions with Cosmos DB and have the data stay in sync
* Continued Synchronization
	* Cosmos DB stays on top of all reads and writes to your data and makes sure data is moved between regions to stay in sync

### Scalability
* Automated
	* Cosmos DB automatically scales to meet resource demand
* Infinite Resources
	* Any number of users of your application can be supported
* Lowest Price
	* Even though the scaling is automatic, you only pay for the resources you use

### Connectivity
* Developer
	* Choose from various software development kits (SDKs) and application programming interfaces (APIs)
* Languages
	* A language for most modern developers, including C#, Java, and Node.js
* Platforms
	* Choose from lots of data platforms to integrate with, including SQL, MongoDB, and Cassandra

### Warning!
Costs can run up quickly!
