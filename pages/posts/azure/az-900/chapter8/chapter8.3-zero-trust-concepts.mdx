## Chapter 8.3 - Zero Trust Concepts

### Classic Trusted vs. Untrusted Model
Trusted Perimeter
Trust boundary for secure access
* Example: Corporate network
* Restrict private access to secure networks

### Challenges with Trusted Perimeter Model
Must be on corporate network to access resources
* Remote work is a challenge
	* VPN is extension of trusted perimeter
* Mobile device access even more challenging
Rogue user/malware inside trusted perimeter network can cause havoc
* Broad scope of access

### Enter Zero Trust
What is Zero Trust?
* All users assumed untrustworthy unless proven otherwise
	* Trusted by identity
	* Regardless of location (trusted/untrusted network)
	* Least privilege access -- just enough permissions to perform job
	* Simplified, centralized managed
Zero Trust = Trusted Identities, Not Location

### Zero Trust in Action
Access Microsoft 365 email, documents, and resources for remote workforce
* Access from anywhere
* Authenticate with identity, not over VPN
Centrally control access with Conditional Access policies
Allow access only from approved managed devices
* Independent from network location
