## Chapter 8.4 - Multi-Factor Authentication

### Approach
* Something you know
* Something you have
* Something you are

### Two Factor Authentication - Example

You are trying to log into a website that requires you to provide your valid email and password for authentication. Getting this correct is one factory of authentication. To make sure you credentials haven't been compromised, a code is sent to your phone, which you receive and enter into the website. The system uses something you know (your username/password) and something you have (your phone) to make sure you can get access into the website. MFA is enabled through Azure Active Directory.
