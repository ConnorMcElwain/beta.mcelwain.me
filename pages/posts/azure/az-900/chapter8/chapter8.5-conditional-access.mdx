# AZ-900 Certification Notes
## Chapter 8.5 - Conditional Access

### Conditional Access Concepts
Authentication Protections beyond Username/Password
* If/then policy to grant access
	* If (user) meets these conditions (signals), then grant/block access to defined applications
* Often paired with multi-factor authentication (MFA)
	* Centrally applied MFA enforcement
		* Does not rely on end user enabling MFA

### How It Works
Create Conditional Access Policy
* Assign signals (conditions)
	* Users/groups
	* Application to grant/deny access
	* Location (IP)
	* Approved devices
* Access decisions (grant/block access)
	* Grant access
	* Block access
	* Require MFA

### Conditional Access Scenarios
* Enforce MFA for all administrators/all users
* Block sign-ins using legacy authentication protocols
* Grant access only to specific locations
* Require organization-managed devices for application sign-in
