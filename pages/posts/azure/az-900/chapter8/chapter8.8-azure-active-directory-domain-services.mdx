# AZ-900 Certification Notes
## Chapter 8.8 - Azure Active Directory Domain Services

### Limitations of Azure AD and Cloud Migrations
Legacy applications
* Unable to use modern authentication protocols (OAuth 2.0)
Require traditional Active Directory (AD DS) management/protocols
* Group Policy
* LDAP
* NTLM
* Kerberos

### Possible Solutions?
Continue using on-premises AD
* Sync to Azure AD with Azure AD Connect
Configure AD server on Azure VM
* Also known as self-managed AD DS
* You maintain/configure the operating system (OS)
Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS)
* Managed Active Directory Domain Services
* Provides classic AD features in a managed service
	* Group Policy, LDAP, Kerberos, domain join

### How Azure AD DS Works
Azure AD DS is a managed service
* No need for OS configuration/management
* Behind the scenes: two Windows domain controllers for high availability
Create unique namespace/domain name
* Example: aadds-companyname.com
* Standalone domain, not extension of on-premises AD domain
One-way sync from Azure AD to Azure AD DS
* Synchronize users, groups, and credentials
* Azure AD may also bidirectional sync with on-premises AD

### Azure AD DS Scenario
Lift and shift legacy enterprise application to Azure VMs
* Application does not support modern authentication
Requirement to integrate application with classic, cloud-hosted AD using managed services
Cloud-hosted legacy application authenticates with Azure AD DS
