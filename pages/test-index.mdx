      During my time as a Network Administration Intern at Prominic.NET, I had the privilege of working directly with the Network Administrator and contributing to the management of Prominic's infrastructure. My responsibilities included the installation and configuration of rack units in client data centers, as well as the provisioning and deployment of new Cisco switches with a focus on ensuring proper configuration within client environments.

I also designed and implemented airflow optimization pods, managed all hardware debugging on physical servers within the primary data center, and designed a cold-spare backup procedure for Cisco switches to ensure high availability and redundancy. Furthermore, I researched, designed, and installed a network video recorder (NVR) system and IP cameras at all company locations, which allowed for greater security and monitoring capabilities.
