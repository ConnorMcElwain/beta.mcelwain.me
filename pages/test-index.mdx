      The Apple Macintosh—later rebranded as the Macintosh 128K—is the original Apple Macintosh
      personal computer. It played a pivotal role in establishing desktop publishing as a general

      in a beige case with integrated carrying handle; it came with a keyboard and single-button
      mouse.
